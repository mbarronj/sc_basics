Supercollider fundamental building blocks, collected from the web, YouTube, and personal work.
These files are works in progress, intended to make my personal use of Supercollider for music
production flow better. 

I'm sharing them so that anyone interested can use them, or provide feedback. Also, so that I can grab them from anywhere myself.
